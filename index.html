         <p>
                Originally from Southern Illinois, I moved to Pennsylvania in 2016. 
                I attended Southern Illinois University and graduated in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Science in Dental Hygiene.
                After 10 years in the Dental Hygiene field, I have decided to switch to tech. 
                I am switching careers due to engage in a more fulfilling career with more opportunities
                to advance and grow. Since childhood, I have always been interested in technology
                and been a great problem solver. Creating my own projects from scratch gives
                me a sense of fulfillment and enjoyment. Someday I would like to create my own gaming
                applications.
